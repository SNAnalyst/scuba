	CHANGES IN scuba VERSION 1.6-0

NEW FUNCTIONS

  o ppO2
  Calculates oxygen partial pressure.

  o Mmix, M0mix
  Calculate maximum tolerated inert gas tensions (M-values)
  for a mixture of inert gases.

NEW DATASETS

   o deepmine
   Dive profile for a long, extremely deep, decompression dive, 
   using mixed gases, in a flooded mine. 
   
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

   o datasets
   All datasets are now lazy-loaded, so it is no longer necessary
   to type 'data(pedro)', etc.

   o hm
   Changed default for 'mixrule' to something more sensible.
   Improved documentation for 'mixrule'.

   o dive
   Now allows begin=NA to suppress assumption that the diver
   descends from the surface at the beginning of dive;
   and allows end=NA to suppress assumption that the diver
   ascends to the surface at the end of dive.

   o introductory vignette
   Improved text.

BUG FIXES

   o haldane
   There was a bug in the calculation of M-values at depth
   (not surfacing M-values). Consequently the results of 
   'haldane(relative=TRUE, deco=TRUE)' were wildly incorrect. 
   [Spotted by Peter Buzzacott.]
   Fixed.
